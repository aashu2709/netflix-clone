# Netflix Clone 

## Overview

This project is a Netflix clone focusing on the signup and choose plan pages. It mimics the user flow of a new user registering for an account and selecting a subscription plan. The goal is to create a clean, responsive, and user-friendly interface that provides a similar experience to Netflix's official website.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The pages are fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on all device sizes.
- **Multi-step Form**: The signup process is split into multiple steps, guiding the user through account creation and plan selection.
 - **Form Validation**: Basic client-side validation is implemented to ensure users provide the necessary information.
- **CSS Animations**: Smooth transitions and animations enhance the user experience.
